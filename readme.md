## AI Image Generator
This AI Image Generator is a web application that creates images based on text descriptions using Stable Diffusion. The app also includes an Image Transformation feature where users can upload their own images and apply transformations, such as a sepia filter, for a vintage look.

Built with Streamlit and Diffusers, this app provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and transforming images using advanced AI models.

## Features
- AI-Powered Image Generation: Generate unique images from text descriptions with adjustable style and resolution.

- Image Customization Options: Customize images by selecting from different styles (Realistic, Abstract, Cartoon, Fantasy) and resolutions (512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048).

- Image-to-Image Transformation: Upload your own images and apply a sepia filter to give them a warm, vintage appearance.
- Download Functionality: Download generated and transformed images directly from the app.
